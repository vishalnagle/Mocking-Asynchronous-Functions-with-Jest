In Jest, both mocks and spyOn are tools used to control, monitor, and verify the behavior of functions or methods during testing. 
However, they serve slightly different purposes and are used in different contexts. 
Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

1. Mocks:

Purpose: Mocks are used to replace entire functions or modules with a mock implementation. 
They allow you to fully control what a function returns or how it behaves during a test.

How It's Used: You can create mock functions using jest.fn() or mock entire modules using jest.mock().

Typical Use Case: Use mocks when you want to completely replace a function or module’s implementation. 
This is useful when you want to simulate behavior, control outputs, or test code in isolation without relying on the actual implementation.


Example of Mocking a Function

const fetchData = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(Promise.resolve('data'));

test('fetchData should return mocked data', async () => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  expect(data).toBe('data');
});


Example of Mocking a Module

jest.mock('./api', () => ({
  getData: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('mocked data'),
}));

import { getData } from './api';

test('getData should return mocked data from module', async () => {
  const data = await getData();
  expect(data).toBe('mocked data');
});


2. spyOn:

Purpose: spyOn is used to monitor calls to an existing method on an object without completely replacing its implementation (although you can modify it if needed). 
It allows you to observe how the method is used, including how many times it’s called, what arguments it’s called with, and more.

How It's Used: You use jest.spyOn(object, 'method') to create a spy on a specific method of an object.

Typical Use Case: Use spyOn when you want to track or verify the behavior of a method without necessarily replacing it, or when you want to mock just one specific method of an object rather than the entire object or module.

Example of spyOn

class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

test('add method should be called with correct arguments', () => {
  const calculator = new Calculator();
  const spy = jest.spyOn(calculator, 'add');

  calculator.add(1, 2);

  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1, 2);
  spy.mockRestore();
});

Key Differences:

1.Scope:

Mocks: Can replace entire functions or modules. You create mock implementations that do not rely on the original implementation.
spyOn: Focuses on monitoring and (optionally) modifying an existing method. The original method is still accessible unless explicitly modified.

2.Control Over Implementation:

Mocks: You define what the mock function does from scratch. The original implementation is not used at all.
spyOn: The original method can still run unless you mock its implementation using mockImplementation, mockReturnValue, etc.

3.Use Case:

Mocks: Best when you need to replace entire functions or modules, especially for isolating tests from dependencies.
spyOn: Best when you need to observe interactions with a method or partially mock the method within its original context.

Summary

Mocks allow you to replace and fully control functions or modules.
spyOn allows you to monitor and optionally modify an existing method without fully replacing it.
